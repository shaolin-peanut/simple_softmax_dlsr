# doing softmax for DLSR
softmax is another name for multi-class logistic regression.
logistic regression basically classifies inputs in two classes, with the sigmoid function (weird name to just determine if 1 or 0).
A softmax regression classifies into more than two classes, so it uses the softmax function which outputs a probability distribution (what's the probability of this input being of class 1, 2, 3, or 4?)

todo:
- [x] understand and implement cost function
- [x] review again gradient descent and backpropagation, then implement
- [ ] do tutorial / visual breakdown of what's going in all the computation within
